    /* Method is a function
       it is a code fragment that we can re-use again

       2 Types of method:
       void ->
       return->

       Parameter vs. argument: parameter, i when I declare method what I allow to be inside the (). Argument is the values given inside parenthesis when caling the method for usage.

       public-> visible to the world it is all accessible in your project classes.
       static-> we can call method without creating object.
       void-> no return type. printing on the screen does not mean it is returning something.
