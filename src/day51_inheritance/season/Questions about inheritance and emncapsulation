Answer these:

	What is the purpose of this keyword
	This keyword indicates the compiler that we are referencing instances.

	What is the purpose of super keyword
	Super keyword indicates the constructor that we are referencing super class.

	Why do we use constructor chaining
	we use constructor chaining to avoid repetition, when variables from a previous created constructor are repeated. It
	 is how we call a constructor inside other constructor.

	Do constructors get inherited, or how do they work in inheritance
	Constructors are not inherited, however, when creating a child class, this one must call the parent constructor by
	using super() key word, this is done manually when the parent class has parameterized constructor. When parent class
	 only has default constructor, compiler calls parent constructor implicitly.
